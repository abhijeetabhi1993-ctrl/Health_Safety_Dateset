-  
*Total Incidents:* 500
 
 
  - Accident: 137
 
  - Illness: 124
 
  - Near Miss: 133
 
  - Property Damage: 106
 

 
 
-  
*Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR):* 5617168 per 1M hours
 
 
-  
*Safety Compliance Effectiveness:* 48%
 
 
-  
*Gender Distribution:* Male (50%) | Female (50%)
 
 

  
### 📈 Dashboard Highlights
